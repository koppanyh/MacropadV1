# MacropadV1
My first totally custom macropad build!

PCB manufacturing files and schematic can be found in the PCB directory.

Run the demo sketch in the Demo directory to verify the macropad as assembled correctly.
It's programmed with the older Arduino IDE version 1.8, with the pro micro as an Arduino Leonardo.
